- **Date:** November 26, 2024
- **Prepared by:** [Sunghee Yun](https://sungheeyun.github.io), [Chanik Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanik-park-14878b32/){:target="_blank"}, and [Don Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-kim-b541b862/){:target="_blank"}

# Executive Summary

We propose to establish a **Medical AI & Biotech Innovation Consortium** that will launch multiple high-impact initiatives targeting the **Life-Long Health Asset Management** market—a multi-billion dollar opportunity emerging from the convergence of AI breakthroughs, aging populations, and the fundamental human need to maintain health throughout extended lifespans.

Rather than pursuing a single focused project, we will build a **portfolio of synergistic initiatives** spanning AI platform development, clinical applications, drug discovery, and health optimization services. This diversified approach:
- **De-risks** the venture through multiple paths to market
- **Accelerates** learning across complementary domains
- **Maximizes** our team's diverse capabilities
- **Positions** Korea to lead multiple aspects of the medical AI revolution

The consortium uniquely leverages our team's unparalleled combination of AI expertise, medical partnerships, industrial execution capability, and strategic networks spanning Silicon Valley, Korea, and global healthcare ecosystems.

# I. The Opportunity - Why Now, Why Us

## The Durable Market Truth

Humans have evolved to live 30-40 years, yet now routinely live 80+ years. This evolutionary mismatch creates permanent demand for solutions that optimize health throughout lifespans our biology was never designed to support. Unlike temporary market trends, this need is:

- **Universal** every aging human faces this challenge
- **Inevitable** cannot be solved through willpower or lifestyle alone
- **Urgent** global populations aging rapidly (Korea leading this trend)
- **Permanent** will persist as long as humans outlive their evolutionary design

## The AI Inflection Point

For the first time, AI capabilities match biological complexity:
- **AlphaFold 3** earning the 2024 Nobel Prize validates AI's transformation of life sciences
- **Multi-modal foundation models** can now integrate genomic, proteomic, imaging, and clinical data
- **Agentic AI systems** can coordinate complex research and clinical protocols
- **Privacy-preserving AI** (homomorphic encryption) enables secure medical data utilization

## Why Only We Can Execute This

Our team represents a once-in-a-generation convergence of capabilities:

**Chanik Park** — Execution power and customer relationships:
- CCO at MangoBoost, direct experience commercializing cutting-edge technology
- Former VP at Samsung Electronics with extensive enterprise sales experience
- Deep understanding of technology adoption cycles in large organizations
- Established relationships with potential enterprise customers
- Proven ability to translate technical capability into business value

**Sunghee Yun** — World-class AI architect with proven track record:

- Direct access to Silicon Valley talent pools and investment communities
- Experience navigating both Korean and American business cultures
- Strategic HR expertise critical for building world-class research organizations

This combination—AI depth, network reach, and execution capability—does not exist in any other Korean team and rarely exists globally.

# II. Strategic Vision - Life-Long Health Asset Management

## The Paradigm Shift

Current healthcare is reactive: treat diseases after they appear. The future is **proactive health asset management**, analogous to financial planning but for the body's most valuable asset.

Just as people plan finances from their 20s for retirement at 65, they should optimize health from youth for vitality at 80+. This requires a comprehensive ecosystem of technologies, services, and partnerships—not a single product.

## The Portfolio Approach - Multiple Synergistic Initiatives

Rather than betting on a single approach, we will pursue **5 parallel initiatives** that address different aspects of the health asset management opportunity:

**Initiative 1 - Medical AI Foundation Model Platform** (Technology Infrastructure)
- Multi-modal AI model integrating genomic, proteomic, imaging, clinical, and lifestyle data
- Core platform that powers other initiatives
- Licensing/API revenue model

**Initiative 2 - AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support Systems** (B2B Healthcare)
- Deployable tools for hospitals and clinics
- Disease-specific applications (oncology, cardiology, neurology)
- Immediate clinical utility and revenue

**Initiative 3 - AI-Accelerated Drug Discovery & Biomarker Platform** (Pharma Partnerships)
- Novel therapeutic target identification
- Biomarker discovery for early disease detection
- Clinical trial optimization
- Partnership revenue + royalties

**Initiative 4 - Personal Health Optimization Service** (B2C Consumer)
- Continuous health monitoring and personalized recommendations
- Integration with wearables and home diagnostics
- Subscription-based premium wellness service

**Initiative 5 - Medical AI Research Consortium** (Ecosystem Building)
- Regular expert gatherings (AI researchers, clinicians, data scientists, industry leaders)
- Government engagement and policy influence
- Talent pipeline and thought leadership

Each initiative has independent value but creates synergies with others. For example:
- Foundation model (Initiative 1) powers clinical tools (Initiative 2) and drug discovery (Initiative 3)
- Clinical partnerships (Initiative 2) provide data for foundation model (Initiative 1)
- Consumer service (Initiative 4) provides real-world validation and additional data
- Research consortium (Initiative 5) attracts talent and funding for all initiatives

This portfolio approach **de-risks** the overall venture while **maximizing optionality** and **accelerating** progress through cross-learning.

# Conclusion

The convergence of AI breakthroughs, aging populations, and Korea's strategic priorities creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build not just a company, but an **entire ecosystem** that positions Korea as the global leader in AI-powered health innovation.

Our **multi-initiative portfolio approach** provides multiple paths to success while creating synergies that no single-focus competitor can match:

- **Initiative 1 (Foundation Model)** establishes technical leadership
- **Initiative 2 (Clinical Tools)** generates immediate revenue and validates technology
- **Initiative 3 (Drug Discovery)** creates high-value pharmaceutical partnerships
- **Initiative 4 (Consumer Health)** builds massive long-term market
- **Initiative 5 (Research Consortium)** attracts talent and influences policy

**Each initiative has independent value. Together, they create an unassailable competitive moat.**

## Why This Team, Why Now

Our founding team uniquely combines:
- **World-class AI expertise** with proven track record across Samsung, Amazon, and biotech
- **Unmatched US-Korea networks** providing access to talent, capital, and partnerships
- **Execution capability** demonstrated through successful technology commercialization
- **Strategic timing** aligned with Korea's national AI priorities and administration support

This combination—AI depth, network reach, execution power, and strategic positioning—**does not exist in any other Korean team and rarely exists globally.**

<!--
## The Choice Before Us

The question is not whether AI will revolutionize healthcare—that is inevitable. The question is whether Korea will lead this revolution or follow others.

- **If we lead:** Korea becomes the Silicon Valley of medical AI, attracting global talent and investment, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs, and improving health outcomes for billions
- **If we follow:** Korea becomes a consumer of foreign medical AI technology, losing economic value and strategic autonomy in this critical domain

**With the right support from leaders like Kim In-Jae and Prof. Kim Jong-Hyuk, we will ensure Korea leads.**

## A Vision Beyond Business

While this plan focuses on execution and economics, the ultimate goal transcends commercial success. We are building solutions to one of humanity's most important challenges: how to live healthily throughout lifespans our biology was never designed to support.

Success means:
- Parents watching their grandchildren grow up with full cognitive vitality
- Diseases detected years before symptoms, when they're most treatable
- Personalized health strategies that work for each individual's unique biology
- Korean medical innovations improving lives globally

This is the optimization problem worth solving—**not just maximizing lifespan, but optimizing for human flourishing in all its dimensions.**

<!--
## The Invitation

We invite Kim In-Jae and Prof. Kim Jong-Hyuk to join us as **founding advisors** in this initiative. Your expertise, networks, and credibility are essential to achieving our vision.

Together, we can:
- Build Korea's leadership position in medical AI
- Create breakthrough solutions for global health challenges
- Establish an ecosystem that benefits patients, clinicians, researchers, and society
- Prove that technology, guided by wisdom and compassion, can genuinely serve human flourishing

**The future of human health will be written in the next few years.**

**We invite you to help us write it.**
