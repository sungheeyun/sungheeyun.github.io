# Abstract

As artificial intelligence transforms every sector from semiconductors to biotechnology, the next generation of technology managers faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities. This seminar provides graduate students in Technology & Innovation Management with essential frameworks for leading AI-driven innovation in an increasingly complex technological landscape.

Drawing from extensive cross-industry experience spanning Silicon Valley startups, Fortune 500 corporations, and cutting-edge research institutions, this session will explore three critical dimensions of AI leadership:

**Knowledge Foundation**: Understanding core AI architectures, from deep learning to agentic AI systems, and their practical implications for technology strategy. We'll examine how AI technologies are reshaping traditional industry boundaries and creating new convergence opportunities across sectors.

**Real-World Experience**: Case studies from semiconductor manufacturing, biotech drug discovery, and e-commerce platforms illustrate how successful technology managers navigate AI implementation challenges. Learn from both breakthrough successes and instructive failures in AI project management across different organizational contexts.

**Strategic Insight**: Develop frameworks for evaluating AI opportunities, managing technology transfer across industries, and building innovation ecosystems that thrive in uncertainty. We'll explore Silicon Valley's cultural engines of innovation and how these principles can be adapted for different markets and organizational structures.

The session will address critical questions facing tomorrow's technology managers: How do you evaluate emerging AI technologies for strategic investment? What organizational capabilities are required for successful AI transformation? How can technology managers bridge the gap between research breakthroughs and market applications?

Through interactive discussions and Q&A, participants will gain practical tools for leading technology teams, making strategic AI decisions, and building careers at the intersection of technology and business innovation. This session is designed to prepare graduate students not just to understand AI technology, but to lead its responsible and effective implementation in their future roles as innovation managers.

**Target Audience**: Graduate students in Technology & Innovation Management, MBA students with technology focus, and emerging professionals in innovation roles.

**Key Takeaways**: Practical frameworks for AI strategy, real-world implementation insights, and career development guidance for technology leadership roles.
