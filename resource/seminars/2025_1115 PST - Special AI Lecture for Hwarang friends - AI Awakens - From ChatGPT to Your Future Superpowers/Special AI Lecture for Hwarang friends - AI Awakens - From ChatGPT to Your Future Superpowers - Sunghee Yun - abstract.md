# Abstract

You've grown up in a world where AI went from science fiction to your pocket in just a few years. ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Grok, Midjourney, Nano Banana AI, NotebookLM, and countless other AI tools are already changing how you learn, create, and connect with the world. But here's the real question - Will AI be something that happens to you, or something you learn to harness as your superpower? This talk is about understanding AI not as intimidating technology, but as a toolkit that your generation can wield to solve problems, build companies, accelerate scientific discoveries, and create things that previous generations could only dream about. From helping doctors diagnose diseases faster, to designing new materials for sustainable energy, to creating personalized learning experiences—AI is becoming the Swiss Army knife of the 21st century, and knowing how to use it could be one of the most valuable skills you develop.

Drawing from real-world experience building AI systems at companies like Amazon, Samsung Semiconductor, Gauss Labs, and biotech startups, and working with universities from Stanford University to Seoul Nation University, Yonsei University, Korea University, Sogang University, DGIST, and KAIST, I'll show you what's actually happening in the AI world beyond the hype. We'll explore how the same technologies behind ChatGPT are being applied to accelerate drug discovery, optimize manufacturing, and even predict protein structures that could cure diseases. You'll see concrete examples of how high school and college students are already using AI to launch startups, conduct meaningful research, and amplify their creative work. More importantly, we'll discuss what this means for the careers and opportunities available to your generation—not just in traditional "tech" roles, but across medicine, environmental science, entertainment, business, law, and fields that don't even exist yet.

The future belongs to those who understand how to collaborate with intelligent systems while bringing uniquely human qualities—creativity, empathy, ethical judgment, and vision—to the table. This talk will equip you with frameworks for thinking about AI's capabilities and limitations, help you understand where the field is heading, and most importantly, inspire you to see yourself as a builder and leader in this transformation rather than a passive consumer. Whether you're interested in STEM, humanities, arts, business, or law, AI will be part of your future. The question is - will you be ready to use it as your superpower?
