# Abstract

The rapid acceleration of artificial intelligence continues to redefine technological boundaries and reshape industries, with particularly transformative implications for semiconductor manufacturing. This seminar provides a comprehensive examination of AI's evolution, current capabilities, and future potential through interconnected perspectives spanning technology, industry applications, and societal impact.

We begin by tracing AI's historical development and analyzing recent breakthrough achievements that have propelled the field forward. This critical assessment distinguishes between substantive progress and potential hype, offering participants a nuanced understanding of where AI technology truly stands today in relation to semiconductor manufacturing needs.

The discussion then expands to explore multimodal AI agents—particularly the transformative impact of large language models—and their applications within semiconductor production environments. We'll examine how these technologies are fundamentally altering manufacturing processes, quality control systems, and supply chain management while raising essential questions about the future of the industry.

The seminar's industrial perspective delves into data-centric approaches to AI implementation, addressing the unique challenges faced when deploying intelligent systems in semiconductor fabrication. We'll investigate how AI is revolutionizing production through advanced automation, productionization strategies, and integrated software ecosystems specifically optimized for semiconductor manufacturing workflows.

Supplementary materials explore serendipitous developments in AI that have benefited semiconductor applications and present frameworks for empowering humanity in an AI-enriched future. Through this comprehensive exploration, participants will gain valuable insights into AI's technological foundations, its specific impact on semiconductor manufacturing, and emerging trajectories that will shape both the industry and society at large.
