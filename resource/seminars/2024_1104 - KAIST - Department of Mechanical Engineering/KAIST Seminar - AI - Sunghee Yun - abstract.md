</h1>

The unprecedented era of AI has arrived far sooner than even the most visionary futurists could have imagined. While the advent of deep learning, with AlexNet showcasing seemingly superhuman capabilities, marked a significant milestone, it was merely a prelude to the revolution that followed. The groundbreaking performance of the Transformer model, introduced by Google researchers at NeurIPS 2017, captivated the world with its ability to generate creative text formats, even producing scripts for "Game of Thrones." Yet, even the very authors of the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" could not have foreseen the rapid emergence of large language models with astonishing capabilities, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, and the Liquid Foundation Model (LFM).

This seminar delves into the rapidly evolving technology and AI hardware driving this revolution, exploring its profound impact on industry, markets, and indeed, the whole of human society. Through this seminar, KAIST students will gain a comprehensive understanding of this transformative field, equipping them to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
