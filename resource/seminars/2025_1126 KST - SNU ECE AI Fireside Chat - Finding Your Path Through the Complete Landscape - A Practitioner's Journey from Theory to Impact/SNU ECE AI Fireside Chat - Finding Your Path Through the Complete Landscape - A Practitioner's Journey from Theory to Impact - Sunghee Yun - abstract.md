# Abstract

Join us for an intimate fireside chat with Dr. Sunghee Yun, who has traversed an unusually broad landscape in AI—from academic research in convex optimization at Stanford under Professor Stephen Boyd, to building recommendation systems at Amazon, founding manufacturing AI startup Gauss Labs, and now pioneering AI-powered biomarker platforms at Gates Foundation-funded Erudio Bio. Rather than a traditional seminar, this gathering offers graduate students a rare opportunity to explore the complete AI ecosystem through candid conversation with someone who has navigated its many dimensions: the mathematical foundations, the realities of Big Tech, the challenges of entrepreneurship, the nuances of cross-industry applications from semiconductors to biotechnology, and the increasingly urgent questions around ethics, societal impact, and what it means to build AI responsibly.

The discussion will span the technical (where is AI actually heading beyond the hype?), the practical (what does the market really value? how do hardware constraints shape what's possible?), the entrepreneurial (how do you know when research is ready for the real world? what does fundraising actually look like?), and the philosophical (how do we navigate hallucinations, biases, and the tension between innovation and human values?). Dr. Yun's path—shaped by rigorous mathematical training, diverse industry experiences across continents, and deep engagement with both cutting-edge technology and its human implications—offers a grounded perspective on these questions that graduate students rarely get to hear in a single, integrated conversation.

This is not about prescribing a single "right path," but rather about opening up the landscape so you can chart your own. Whether you're wrestling with academic vs. industry choices, curious about what entrepreneurship really entails, wondering how to apply AI meaningfully across different domains, or simply trying to understand where you might fit in this rapidly evolving field, this fireside chat welcomes your questions and reflections. Come prepared for honest dialogue about both the opportunities and the complexities of building a life and career in AI.
