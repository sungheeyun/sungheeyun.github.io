# Abstract

This talk provides a comprehensive exploration of the AI-biotech convergence through the lens of Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem, drawing on cross-industry experience spanning semiconductor manufacturing, e-commerce platforms, and AI-powered biotechnology. Moving beyond isolated breakthroughs like AlphaFold's protein folding revolution, we examine how fundamental shifts in AI architectures—from deep learning through large language models to agentic AI systems—are creating unprecedented opportunities for drug discovery and precision medicine. The presentation maps the complete landscape: the mathematical foundations enabling these advances, the hardware innovations making them scalable, the business models sustaining them, and most critically, the practical pathways from research insights to clinical impact.

Through the specific lens of building AI-powered biomarker platforms for next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics, we explore how Silicon Valley's cultural and technological frameworks are being adapted to solve biotechnology's most challenging problems: data scarcity in clinical contexts, the complexity of biological systems, and the translation gap between computational predictions and therapeutic outcomes. This holistic view connects technological capabilities with market realities, regulatory landscapes, and ultimately, human health outcomes—illustrating not just what AI can do for biotech, but how cross-disciplinary innovation, informed by real-world implementation experience, is reshaping the future of medicine from the ground up.
