# Feedback on AI Lecture Series

## Overall Impression

The five AI lectures delivered over the past four days covered an exceptionally broad and deep range of topics—from the history of AI, core algorithms, and the nature and limitations of LLMs, to ethical and philosophical discussions, and Silicon Valley's technological culture. The lectures were received by students not merely as knowledge transfer, but as a transformative experience that expanded their entire framework of thinking.

The following aspects were particularly impressive to students:

- <span style="color: red;">**Viewing AI not as an algorithm or tool, but as a &ldquo;social system&rdquo;**</span>
- <span style="color: blue;">Understanding the essence of LLMs (conditional probability models), their limitations, and recognizing hallucination as a structural characteristic rather than a defect</span>
- <span style="color: red;">The interactive, discussion-based lecture format centered on Q&A rather than theory-focused instruction</span>
- <span style="color: red;">Insights into Silicon Valley culture, trust in engineers, and the significance of physical proximity and clustering</span>
- <span style="color: blue;">Real-world case studies from bio AI, multimodal systems, and robotics</span>

Many students expressed sentiments such as:

> <span class="emph">Deep insights that are difficult to find on the web</span>

> <span class="emph">My entire perspective on AI has completely changed</span>

They reported gaining tremendous inspiration both academically and in terms of career direction.

## Key Impressive Topics

### Paradigm Shift in Understanding LLMs and Hallucination

- Understanding hallucination not simply as an error or bug, but as **<span style="color: red;">the structural engine that enables LLM creativity and performance</span>**
- The discussion that "a model with hallucination completely suppressed might lose its appeal"
- Through comparisons with human cognitive biases and confirmation bias, gaining a multidimensional understanding of commonalities and differences between AI and human intelligence

### Historical and Structural Understanding of AI Technology Evolution

- The progression from Symbolism → Connectionism → Transformer → LLM
- Clear understanding that performance breakthroughs result not from simple model size increases, but from the combination of **<span style="color: red;">architectural changes + data + computing resources</span>**
- Explanation of nonlinear performance improvements that occur when crossing critical thresholds

### Ethical, Philosophical, and Social Discussions Beyond Technology

- The risks of AI anthropomorphization
- Legal responsibility, fairness, and issues in social decision-making applications
- Awareness of AI not as "well-functioning technology" but as **<span style="color: red;">a system with social influence</span>**

# Requests for Advanced Learning

## Common Requests for the Remaining Three Lectures

Student requests can be organized into four main axes:

### Real-World, Production-Level AI Use Cases from Silicon Valley

This was the most commonly requested topic among students.

- How Big Tech and startups are actually integrating LLMs into real services
- How RAG, AI Agents, and multimodal AI are implemented **<span style="color: red;">not as conceptual ideas, but as operational workflows and technology stacks</span>**
- Production environment challenges (bottlenecks, data pipelines, operational issues) beyond simple demos

> <span class="emph">We're curious about how it's actually being used in the field, more than theory.</span>

### Business Impact and Market Changes Driven by AI Technology

- How generative AI and LLMs are reshaping:
  - Corporate revenue structures
  - Existing business models
  - Sources of competitive advantage
- How technological possibilities are transformed into "monetizable value" through strategy and decision-making
- How technology–market–organization align in Silicon Valley

### Realistic Stories About Career Paths, Careers, and Entrepreneurship

Many students showed significant interest in your personal choices and experiences.

- The decisive moment that led you to decide on entrepreneurship
- The most challenging moments in the startup process and how you overcame them
- Criteria for whom you would recommend entrepreneurship
- **<span style="color: red;">Realistic routes and examples</span>** for Korean undergraduate students to enter Silicon Valley startups/Big Tech
- Competencies currently required in the Silicon Valley job market

### Questions About "Human Capabilities That Remain in the AI Era"

- To what extent can developers delegate to AI, and what must they verify?
- Beyond simple coding ability, what are the **<span style="color: red;">enduring core competencies (thinking skills, questioning ability, verification skills)</span>**?
- Human roles and tasks that will become more important in the AI era

# Conclusion and Words of Gratitude

This lecture series became a turning point that helped students recognize AI technology as **<span style="color: red;">"an entity to think with" rather than "a subject to learn."</span>**

Many students reported that they began to seriously reconsider:
- Their major choices
- Whether to pursue graduate studies
- Entrepreneurship and career directions

On behalf of the students in the School of Computer Science at Kyungpook National University, we sincerely thank you for sharing deep insights and candid perspectives despite your busy schedule.

We look forward to the remaining lectures with great anticipation.
