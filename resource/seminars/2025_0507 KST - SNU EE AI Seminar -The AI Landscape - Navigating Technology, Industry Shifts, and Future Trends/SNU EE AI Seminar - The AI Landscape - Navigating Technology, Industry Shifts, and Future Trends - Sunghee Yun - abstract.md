# Abstract

This seminar explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries and society. The speaker, a seasoned expert with experience at Samsung, Amazon, and as a startup founder, provides an in-depth analysis of AI’s evolution, from its foundational technologies like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to breakthroughs such as transformers and large language models (LLMs). Key milestones, including AlphaGo, ChatGPT, and AlphaFold, are highlighted to illustrate AI’s rapid advancements and its potential to revolutionize fields like healthcare, manufacturing, and creative industries.  

A significant focus is placed on the rise of AI agents and multimodal AI systems, which integrate text, audio, and visual data to mimic human cognitive abilities. The discussion covers their applications in scientific research, environmental monitoring, and customer service, as well as future trends like ubiquitous AI integration and personalized experiences. The speaker also addresses the ethical considerations and societal implications of AI, emphasizing the need for transparency, fairness, and responsible innovation to ensure trust and alignment with human values.  

Finally, the seminar delves into Silicon Valley’s innovation ecosystem, drawing lessons from companies like Amazon and startups such as Gauss Labs and Erudio Bio. The speaker shares insights on bridging cultural and operational gaps between Silicon Valley and global tech hubs like Korea, advocating for customer-centric innovation, long-term vision, and cross-cultural collaboration. The presentation concludes with actionable strategies for leveraging AI to solve real-world challenges while navigating the complexities of technology adoption and market dynamics.
