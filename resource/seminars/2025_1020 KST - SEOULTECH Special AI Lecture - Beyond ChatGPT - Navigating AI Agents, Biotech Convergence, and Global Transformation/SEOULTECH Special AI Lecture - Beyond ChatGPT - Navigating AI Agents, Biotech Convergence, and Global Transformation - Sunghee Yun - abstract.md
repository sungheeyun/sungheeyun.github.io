# Abstract

The world is witnessing an unprecedented acceleration in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with recent breakthroughs moving beyond foundational models like ChatGPT. This lecture will provide SEOULTECH students with a comprehensive overview of the current AI landscape, exploring the key shifts from traditional big data and deep learning to the rise of sophisticated AI agents. We will delve into the underlying mechanisms that power this new generation of models, examining how successes in large language models (LLMs) are paving the way for advancements in multimodal AI that can reason across various data types, from text to video.

We will also explore the powerful and rapidly converging fields of AI and biotechnology. The seminar will highlight how AI is transforming biological sciences, with a special focus on recent landmark achievements like AlphaFold 3, which has revolutionized protein structure prediction. We will discuss how this convergence is not just a theoretical concept but a practical reality that is accelerating drug discovery, enabling personalized medicine, and fundamentally reshaping scientific research. The discussion will touch on the challenges and opportunities presented by the exponential growth and biases in biological data, emphasizing the critical role of data quality and management.

Furthermore, this lecture will address the broader societal, ethical, and legal implications of this technological transformation. Weâ€™ll look at the "hype cycle" of AI and evaluate whether we are in a sustainable period of growth, drawing comparisons to past technological shifts like the internet and cloud computing. The seminar will challenge the audience to think critically about key philosophical questions, such as whether AI can truly possess knowledge, belief, or the ability to reason, and the risks of anthropomorphizing these powerful tools.

Ultimately, this lecture is designed to equip SEOULTECH students with the knowledge to navigate this evolving landscape. We'll explore how these advancements are not just reshaping industries but also creating new opportunities for human-AI collaboration. Join us as we look beyond the hype and dive into the core technologies and future trends that will define the next wave of global innovation, empowering you to become a key part of this transformative era.
