# Abstract

"The AI Paradigm Shift" seminar explores the transformative journey of artificial intelligence from its early conceptual foundations to today's revolutionary applications, examining the technological breakthroughs that have reshaped our world. The presentation traces AI's evolution through pivotal developments—from the deep learning revolution and AlphaGo's milestone victory to the game-changing Transformer architecture and the proliferation of advanced models like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and specialized applications in healthcare and robotics. By analyzing AI's unprecedented adoption rates, explosive ecosystem growth, and massive investment surge, the seminar provides critical context for understanding both the current state of AI technology and its extraordinary economic potential.

Beyond technological achievements, the seminar delves into the emergence of multimodal AI agents and their profound implications for human society. These systems—capable of processing information across multiple modalities and making integrated decisions—are poised to revolutionize scientific research, healthcare diagnostics, creative collaboration, and countless other domains. The discussion culminates with an exploration of AI's dual nature as both blessing and curse, addressing critical challenges including job displacement, bias perpetuation, and ethical dilemmas. Drawing from insights gained through the KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative, the seminar outlines strategies for empowering humanity in an AI-enriched future through capacity building, regulatory frameworks, and a paradigm shift in technological implementation that transforms automation from replacement to enhancement of human capabilities.
