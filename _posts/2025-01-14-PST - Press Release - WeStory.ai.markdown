<!--WeStory.AI Revolutionizes Storytelling with AI-Driven Narratives-->

Cupertino, CA – WeStory.ai, a pioneering platform, proudly announces its latest innovation in personal and family storytelling.
Using a combination of cutting-edge AI agents like ChatGPT, Claude, Mistral, and Gemini, WeStory.ai reconnects individuals through immersive, interactive interviews that craft rich, personal narratives.

&ldquo;At WeStory.ai, we believe in the power of stories to revive and celebrate lives,&rdquo; said Juyong Do, CEO of WeStory.ai.
&ldquo;Our AI agents have helped many, especially the elderly, realize the value of their life stories, leaving a meaningful legacy for future generations.&rdquo;

The platform has seen remarkable success, with over 200 individuals publishing their stories as Amazon e-books, and 35 turning their narratives into physical books.
Customers have expressed how the process has given them newfound appreciation for their lives.
&ldquo;Writing my story with WeStory.AI made me realize how meaningful my life has been,&rdquo; shared one customer.
&ldquo;I now have a legacy to leave behind for my children and grandchildren.&rdquo;

Financially, WeStory.ai has generated $500,000 in revenue over the past year and has secured contracts ensuring $2.5 million in recurring revenue moving forward.
The company has also started donating a portion of its earnings to nonprofit organizations like the K-Diaspora and other like-minded groups, reinforcing its commitment to societal impact.

The collaboration with the K-Diaspora program has further highlighted WeStory.ai’s ability to capture significant cultural narratives, adding to its growing reputation.
Looking ahead, WeStory.ai plans to expand into new business models such as AI-generated movie scenarios, continuing its mission to bridge technological gaps and foster human connections.
