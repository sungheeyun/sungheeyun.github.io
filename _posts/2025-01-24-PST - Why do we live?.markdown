Like most people, I have often pondered why we live and, more specifically, why I live or should live. Throughout different stages of my life, I've found various answers, including the possibility that there is no answer at all.

Before developing sufficient capacity for philosophical thinking and logical reasoning, my thoughts wandered aimlessly. As the child of non-religious parents, I didn't rely on divine beings to find meaning. During high school, I explored Christianity but found its answers unsatisfactory, as the Bible failed to convincingly demonstrate God's existence,
hence
for example,
making &ldquo;the purpose-driven life&rdquo; arguments unconvincing.

A turning point came when I read the two-volume biography of Ludwig Wittgenstein, subtitled "Duties of a Genius."
As soon as I saw the subtitle,
it triggered something inside me
(though I did not and could not understand fully why that time).
I interpreted it thus: Wittgenstein recognized his exceptional intellect, acknowledging he had no equal among his contemporaries. He knew he surpassed even his advisor Bertrand Russell in many ways, particularly in philosophy, and this awareness of his rare gift led him to feel obligated to contribute to humanity. This insight struck me deeply, compelling me to search for my own purpose, even though I didn't consider myself his intellectual equal.

The feeling and the insight I got
while and after reading the books
struck me deeply,
compelling me to search for my own purpose,
even though I did not consider myself his intellectual equal that time.

This idea persisted until at least 2017, as I recall mentioning it during a phone conversation. However, since 2015, I had become deeply interested in Buddha's original teachings, distinct from Buddhist religious doctrine. As I explored concepts of mercy, compassion, nirvana, enlightenment, and AnƒÅtman, these teachings transformed my life and eventually led me to nirvana. During this period, influenced by Buddhist thought, I concluded that life had no inherent meaning. I clearly understood and accepted the randomness of my existence - after all, I resulted from the chance meeting of a particular sperm and egg.

While this element of chance is undeniable, I've recently come to understand that the meaning of life still exists.
Few people can understand this argument,
but the conclusion that life has no inherent meaning is right,
but at the same time wrong.
To be more precise,
it's not not-right, nor not-wrong
for the following reasons.
&mdash;
It transcends the binary of right and wrong for reasons that defy verbal and logical articulation - here
we encounter the limits of language to capture certain fundamental truths
(as Wittgenstein insisted).


The fundamental error that I, and virtually everyone throughout history, have made is asking "What is the meaning of my life?" or "Why do I live?" The right question is "Do I want meaning in my life?" Meaning isn't an inherent truth waiting to be discovered. It isn't universally accessible or predetermined. Rather, it's something we actively create through our will and intention. The meaning of life is what we create as active and autonomous agents, not something bestowed by others, even by some absolute being endorsed by holy scriptures.
