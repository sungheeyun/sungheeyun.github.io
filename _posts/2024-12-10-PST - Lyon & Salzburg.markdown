<h1 id="lyon">Lyon</h1>

In late 2024 (31-Nov-2024 ~ 09-Dec-2024), I embarked on a transformative European journey that wove together cutting-edge AI technology, global policy discussions, and rich cultural experiences.
The journey began in Lyon, France, where I was invited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung_Hee_Cheon">a longtime colleague</a> - both a mathematics professor at Seoul National University and CEO of <a href="https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/">CryptoLab</a> - to conduct <a href="/#sem-2024">an AI seminar and consultation</a> at their research center.
This intensive four-day engagement centered on the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic cryptography</a>, highlighting how academia and industry can collaborate to push the boundaries of secure AI implementations.

The narrow, intimate streets wind through historic neighborhoods where Haussmann-style buildings, with their ornate iron balconies and tall windows,
create an elegant corridor.
<!--At the end of the street, perched majestically on Fourvière hill,

Standing on the Pont Lafayette in Lyon,
I found myself mesmerized by the Rhône River
-
the very waterway that flows through countless pages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanami_Shiono">Shiono Nanami</a>'s masterpiece
&ldquo;Roma-jin no Monogatari.&rdquo; (Stories of the Romans; &ldquo;Res Gestae Populi Romani&rdquo; in Latin)
The river stretches before me
like a sheet of polished steel under the winter sky,
its surface rippling gently in the early morning light.
Here was the very river that had carried Roman vessels,
influenced empires, and inspired one of Japan's most remarkable works of classical history.
That morning on the bridge, literature and reality merged into a single, unforgettable moment.
There standing on Pont Lafayette, I finally had a chance to see the Rhône! Truly historic moment of mine!

During our discussions, we delved into profound questions about the nature of Large Language Models (LLM) (and AI itself).
We contemplated how systems based on conditional probability estimation and pattern recognition could demonstrate such remarkable capabilities—ones
that not only <font class="emph">seem to</font> match but sometimes (seem to) surpass human abilities
(whatever we mean by human abilities).
The intellectual caliber of these conversations required deep reasoning and keen insight, making the experience all the more enriching and stimulating.
This was all possible thanks to the genius of the members of
<a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/A3WQi15NgXMhqJax9">Lyon CryptoLab Research Center</a>.
Our discussions led us to a crucial realization:
rather than debating whether AI has or will develop consciousness, the more fundamental question is understanding what consciousness itself means.
It's striking
(almost) no debate about AI consciousness proceeds with acknowledging
that we lack a concrete definition of consciousness, making subsequent arguments inherently fragile.


For a deeper exploration of these concepts from cognitive and philosophical perspectives,
I invite you to review

My journey as a
<a href="https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative">KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow</a>
took me from Lyon to the historic city of Salzburg, Austria
(where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> was born and raised).
The program was hosted at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEZ5F2kXRrPEJiwZ6">the majestic Schloss Leopoldskron</a>,
a baroque palace that served as the perfect backdrop for deep intellectual discourse and global collaboration.

There, I found myself among an extraordinary cohort of leaders representing diverse institutions including the United Nations (UN),
European Union (EU), academia, and both public and private sectors.
We had gathered for an ambitious program titled
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.salzburgglobal.org/multi-year-series/kfas/pageId/11076">Uncertain Futures and Connections Reimagined: Connecting Technologies</a>,&rdquo;
which brought together minds from across the globe to address pressing technological challenges.

As a member of the &ldquo;<a href="https://salzburgglobalseminar-ai.github.io/">Technology, Growth, and Inequality: The Case of AI</a>&rdquo; working group,
I delved into profound discussions about artificial intelligence's impact on society and economy.
Our focus centered on critical issues that define our technological future: the widening digital divide,
ensuring equitable access to technology, addressing potential job displacement, and bridging the growing tech gap between different populations.
Together, we worked to develop concrete strategies that could help shape a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.
We share our deliverables via <a href="https://salzburgglobalseminar-ai.github.io/">the website</a> we developed as the first action items.

One of the most fascinating aspects of my experience was experiencing how individuals from vastly different backgrounds approached problems and reasoned through solutions.
I was particularly intrigued by the perspectives of those from non-profit organizations, policy-making roles, and legal backgrounds—their insights reflected years of trial-and-error, sharing both the successes and failures encountered while implementing various policies and initiatives.
This diversity of thought was genuinely thrilling!
No, thrilling is an understatement!

I was equally grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these rich discussions by drawing from my own technical expertise,
particularly in AI and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/">Convex Optimization</a>.
My journey—from pursuing a Ph.D., to developing AI software for cutting-edge semiconductor technologies at Samsung,
to maximizing revenue through AI algorithms and software services via Amazon's Mobile Shopping App,
and finally to leading the whole R&amp;D and US Headquarters of <a href="https://www.gausslabs.ai/">Gauss Labs</a>
in <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9sDyHjEdAFZoAXNH9">Palo Alto</a>—provided unique insights into the technological landscape.
Being at the heart of Silicon Valley,
the birthplace of modern semiconductors, digital communication, internet, mobile technology, smart devices, and now the AI revolution,
allowed me to bring practical, but yet fundamentally deep perspectives to these important discussions about our technological future.

I was honored to be given a chance to articulate these core beliefs about technology and solutions to its challenges
in an interview with Salzburg Global Seminar.
You can see the interview here.

<h1 id="technology">My philosophy (and truth) I uphold for technology and humankind</h1>

My core philosophy, which resonated strongly throughout the Salzburg discussions,
is that technology and AI must become the solution to the very challenges they create.
While advancing AI capabilities, we must ensure that no one is left behind or marginalized.
This requires three essential elements: the right philosophy, genuine good will, and most crucially, effective execution.
The fellowship has established ongoing commitments, both online and in-person,
to raise global awareness and drive meaningful change in how we develop and deploy AI technologies.

<h1 id="mozart">Then Mozart</h1>

Before departing Salzburg, I had the profound privilege of visiting <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PSz1vrSvyuPAwHaV8">Mozart's birthplace</a>.
Walking through the rooms where one of humanity's greatest musical geniuses lived and created was truly moving.
Seeing his original portraits, family memorabilia, and the instruments he played offered a tangible connection to his extraordinary legacy.
Standing in the space where such remarkable creativity flourished was a powerful reminder of human potential and genius - a fitting reflection point as we work to ensure AI enhances rather than diminishes human capability.

<h1 id="mozart">Finally München</h1>

My journey concluded with a delightful excursion to München.
The timing couldn't have been more perfect, as I arrived during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas_Day">the Feast of Saint Nicholas</a>.
The streets came alive with the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus">Krampus</a> parade, offering a fascinating glimpse into centuries-old Alpine folklore.
The Gothic splendor of München's Rathaus provided a stunning architectural backdrop as I sampled traditional German winter delights - warming myself with Glühwein and savoring hearty Bavarian classics like Schweinshaxe and Schnitzel.

This journey underscored a crucial insight:
the future of AI must be shaped not just by technological advancement, but by a deep understanding of its human impact and cultural context.
From the technical depths of cryptography in Lyon to the global policy discussions in Salzburg,
through the inspiring genius of Mozart, and finally to the cultural richness of München,
each experience reinforced
that successful AI development requires a holistic approach that considers technical innovation, societal impact, and human values in equal measure.
