<h1 id="lyon">Lyon</h1>

In late 2024 (31-Nov-2024 ~ 09-Dec-2024), I embarked on a transformative European journey that wove together cutting-edge AI technology, global policy discussions, and rich cultural experiences.
The journey began in Lyon, France, where I was invited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung_Hee_Cheon">a longtime colleague</a> - both a mathematics professor at Seoul National University and CEO of <a href="https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/">CryptoLab</a> - to conduct <a href="/#sem-2024">an AI seminar and consultation</a> at their research center.
This intensive four-day engagement centered on the intersection of artificial intelligence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic cryptography</a>, highlighting how academia and industry can collaborate to push the boundaries of secure AI implementations.

<h1 id="salzburg">Salzburg</h1>

From Lyon, I traveled to the historic city of Salzburg as a
<a href="https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative">KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow</a>.
At <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEZ5F2kXRrPEJiwZ6">the majestic Schloss Leopoldskron</a>,
I joined a diverse cohort of leaders from the UN, EU, academia,
and both public and private sectors for the program
&ldquo;<a href="https://www.salzburgglobal.org/multi-year-series/kfas/pageId/11076">Uncertain Futures and Connections Reimagined: Connecting Technologies.</a>&rdquo;
As part of the &ldquo;<a href="https://salzburgglobalseminar-ai.github.io/">Technology, Growth, and Inequality: The Case of AI</a>&rdquo; working group,
I engaged in profound discussions about AI's societal and economic impacts.
We tackled crucial issues including technological disparity, equitable access, job displacement,
and the growing tech gap, working to develop actionable strategies for positive change.

<h1 id="technology">My philosophy (or rather truth) I uphold for technology and humankind</h1>

My core philosophy, which resonated strongly throughout the Salzburg discussions,
is that technology and AI must become the solution to the very challenges they create.
While advancing AI capabilities, we must ensure that no one is left behind or marginalized.
This requires three essential elements: the right philosophy, genuine good will, and most crucially, effective execution.
The fellowship has established ongoing commitments, both online and in-person,
to raise global awareness and drive meaningful change in how we develop and deploy AI technologies.

I was honored to be given a chance to articulate these core beliefs about technology and solutions to its challenges
in an interview with Salzburg Global Seminar.
You can see the interview here.

<h1 id="mozart">Then Mozart</h1>

Before departing Salzburg, I had the profound privilege of visiting <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PSz1vrSvyuPAwHaV8">Mozart's birthplace</a>.
Walking through the rooms where one of humanity's greatest musical geniuses lived and created was truly moving.
Seeing his original portraits, family memorabilia, and the instruments he played offered a tangible connection to his extraordinary legacy.
Standing in the space where such remarkable creativity flourished was a powerful reminder of human potential and genius - a fitting reflection point as we work to ensure AI enhances rather than diminishes human capability.

<h1 id="mozart">Finally München</h1>

My journey concluded with a delightful excursion to München.
The timing couldn't have been more perfect, as I arrived during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas_Day">the Feast of Saint Nicholas</a>.
The streets came alive with the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus">Krampus</a> parade, offering a fascinating glimpse into centuries-old Alpine folklore.
The Gothic splendor of München's Rathaus provided a stunning architectural backdrop as I sampled traditional German winter delights - warming myself with Glühwein and savoring hearty Bavarian classics like Schweinshaxe and Schnitzel.

<h1 id="human">Human, human, and human!</h1>

This journey underscored a crucial insight:
the future of AI must be shaped not just by technological advancement, but by a deep understanding of its human impact and cultural context.
From the technical depths of cryptography in Lyon to the global policy discussions in Salzburg,
through the inspiring genius of Mozart, and finally to the cultural richness of München,
each experience reinforced
that successful AI development requires a holistic approach that considers technical innovation, societal impact, and human values in equal measure.
