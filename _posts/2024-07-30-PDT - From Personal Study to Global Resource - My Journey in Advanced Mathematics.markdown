<h2>Introduction</h2>

For hours, protesters furious over the Biden administrationâ€™s support for Israel and its failure to end the war in Gaza held signs, chanted and pushed for Ms. Harris to break with the president on those issues. The loudest challenge to the opening day of the Democratic National Convention was coming not from Republicans, but from the progressive left.

Mathematics has always been a profound passion of mine because of the pure beauty I found and the fun that I can have exploring it. This passion has led me through the intricate landscapes of abstract algebra, measure theory, convex optimization, linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning. I started making slides using LaTeX for me to revisit the topics later, but it grew enormously large, and I realized its potential as a comprehensive resource that I am thrilled to share with the world. This article, born from my extensive slides and research, is designed to benefit advanced learners and professionals who share my enthusiasm for mathematics. Through clear explanations and detailed proofs, I aim to make complex concepts more accessible and engaging.

<h2>The Beginning - a personal quest</h2>

My journey started with a simple goal: to create a structured way to study and retain advanced mathematical concepts. I began by documenting my slides on topics that challenged and intrigued me, such as algebraic structures, real analysis, and measure theory. Over time, these slides grew into a detailed collection, covering various areas of mathematics.

<h2>Growth and Expansion - from slides to comprehensive content</h2>

As my slides expanded, I recognized their potential to serve as a valuable resource for others. I carefully organized and refined the content to ensure it was clear and comprehensive. This process made the material more accessible and allowed me to present it in a format suitable for a wider audience. By focusing on clarity and depth, I aimed to create a resource that would be both informative and engaging.

<h2>Sharing with the World - a resource for advanced learners</h2>

My primary audience for this article is advanced learners and professionals deeply engaged in mathematical studies. While the content is advanced and may not be suitable for the general public, it holds immense value for those seeking a deeper understanding of topics such as abstract algebra, measure theory, convex optimization, linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning. My goal is to provide a comprehensive resource that enhances their learning experience and serves as a reliable reference.

<h2>Future Plans - expanding the horizon</h2>

This article is just the beginning. I plan to continue expanding the content, covering more topics such as linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, and combinatorial optimization. My vision is to create a comprehensive library of advanced mathematical content that can serve as a valuable resource for students, educators, and professionals worldwide.

<h2>Conclusion - mathematics as a shared journey</h2>

Mathematics is a universal language that has the power to connect and inspire. By sharing this article, I hope to contribute to not only the mathematical community, but all fields requiring mathematically and scientifically rigorous disciplines together with potential applications providing impacts on the human race. Whether you are an advanced learner seeking to deepen your understanding or a professional looking for a reliable reference, I invite you to explore this article and join me in the fascinating journey of mathematical discovery.

<h2>Stay Connected!!</h2>

I encourage you to share your thoughts, questions, and feedback. Together, we can continue to learn, grow, and appreciate the beauty and utility of mathematics.
