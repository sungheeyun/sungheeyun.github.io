### Cultural Bridge Talk - "From Engineering to Music: Following Your Heart" (6:30pm ~ 7:20pm)

**Interactive Presentation for the Whole Family**

**The Universal Language of Music** will open our main presentation, exploring how melodies transcend the barriers of language, age, and cultural backgrounds that might otherwise separate us. Maestro Baek will share insights into the mathematical beauty behind musical compositions, perfect for our Silicon Valley community where many parents work in technical fields. He'll demonstrate how Korean traditional music and Western classical traditions complement rather than compete with each other, creating richer musical experiences when combined.

**Generational Musical Memories** forms the heart of our cultural bridge discussion. We'll journey through the musical landscapes that have shaped each generation in our community. Our grandparents carry within them the traditional Korean folk songs that tell stories of seasons, love, and resilience passed down through centuries. Parents in our audience often experienced how classical music training deepened their appreciation for Korean musical heritage, creating unexpected connections between seemingly different worlds. For our children, we'll explore how discovering their identity through both Korean and Western musical traditions enriches rather than confuses their sense of self.

**Interactive Family Moments** will bring everyone together through hands-on musical experiences. Families will learn simple Korean 장단 (jangdan) rhythm patterns, clapping together in harmonies that echo traditional Korean percussion. Children will have the delightful opportunity to learn basic conducting gestures, transforming them into little maestros leading their own family orchestras. We'll create space for brief musical memory sharing, inviting families to reflect on what music means in their homes and how it connects them to both their heritage and their daily American lives.
