# The Convergence - AI, Data, and Biotech

<blockquote>
&hellip;
this immediate recognition signals the Nobel Committee's acknowledgment of AI's transformative potential.
</blockquote>

In 2024, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to a non-chemist—Demis Hassabis, CEO of [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).
This unprecedented recognition came primarily due to [AlphaFold 3](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/), which can accurately predict the 3D folding of virtually any protein that could exist in the world.
While Nobel Prizes typically recognize contributions that have proven their value over decades, this immediate recognition signals the Nobel Committee's acknowledgment of this technology's transformative potential.

This achievement reveals two critical aspects of AI:

- First, its remarkable versatility.
The same algorithmic foundations (essentially deep reinforcement learning complemented by Monte Carlo tree search)
that once mastered Go at the world champion level have been adapted to predict protein folding with unprecedented accuracy and predictability.
- Second, AI&mdash;particularly with current deep neural network architectures&mdash;requires vast amounts of quality data.
AlphaGo leveraged thousands of years of Go play history from China, Japan, and Korea.
Similarly, AlphaFold built upon decades of biochemists' painstaking work.

# The AI Vision of Erudio Bio

This understanding drives Erudio Bio's AI vision. We're not merely developing multiplexing biomarker detection and screening technology. We're building an <font class="emph">AI-powered multiplexing biomarker data platform for Agentic AI</font> that delivers differentiated value through quality biological data at scale.

With this foundation, Erudio Bio can:
- Perform knowledge discovery using AI, <i>e.g.</i>, predicting cancer probability or hospital readmission risk
- Develop bio data business models similar to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/)'s established approach

# The Connection to Private AI

The moment we engage with biological or medical data, we encounter privacy challenges
as well as similar to those in high-tech industries like semiconductor fabrication;
I have first-hand experience with this while working for [Gauss Labs, Inc.](https://www.gausslabs.ai/) as CTO for 3 years.
This explains my role as Advisor at [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/)&mdash;not a coincidence but an inevitability.

[CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/) provides essential toolkits for private AI&mdash;enabling model training on privacy-sensitive data
without compromising security, confidentiality, or privacy.
This connection prompted me to found [the Silicon Valley Private AI Forum (K-PAI)](https://k-privateai.github.io/)
with the CEO of [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/).

Thus, the companies and forums I own or support through business development are all interconnected parts of a coherent vision.

# The Age of Agentic AI

{% assign ai_data = site.posts | where: "permalink", "/ai/data" | first %}

Taking a broader view, as I explain in [{{ ai_data.title }}]({{ ai_data.url }}),
we've entered <font class="emph">the age of Agentic AI</font>.
In this era, domain expertise combined with the ability
to leverage AI agents has become crucial—which explains my work with [WeStory.ai](https://westory.ai/).

# Beyond Technology - AI's Unprecedented Impact

I believe AI transcends the category of "just another technology" like the Industrial Revolution, Internet, or Mobile.
While it shares traits with these transformations—such as its vast impact radius—the dynamics and nature of AI's effects are unprecedented.
(I'll explore this further in an upcoming post.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>)

This perspective drives me to seek opportunities where I can contribute to humanity
through my differentiated insights, technological knowledge,
and fundamental understanding of AI algorithms—all built
on a strong mathematical foundation and capacity for deep philosophical thinking.

This mission led me to join [Salzburg Global Seminar](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/),
a 78-year-old nonprofit organization,
as a
[KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative).
