Before founding the new AI biotech company,
I co-founded <a href="https://www.gausslabs.ai/">Gauss Labs, Inc.</a>, an industrial AI company,
built and ran <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/v2cLgonB46fL9CPh8">the US Headquarters of Gauss Labs</a>,
spearheaded research &amp; development of the core technology &amp; products.
Before <a href="https://www.gausslabs.ai/">Gauss Labs</a>, I drove various AI technology and product developments
and productionizations in the field of e-Commerce @ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com, Inc.</a> where one of the projects
created a 200 USD revenue increase via the Amazon Mobile Shopping App.
Before <a href="https:///www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>,
I worked for
Software Research Center,
Strategic Sales &amp; Marketing Team,
Design Technology Team
&amp;
Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) Team
of <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/">Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.</a>
where
I developed diverse AI and optimization tools
for semiconductor chip designers, manufacturing engineers &amp; test engineers
where
more than 200 engineers still use the circuit optimization tools
and generic AI optimization platform, dubbed iOpt,
every day.

I received a BS degree
in <a href="https://eng.snu.ac.kr/snuEng/main/contents.do?menuNo=200084">Electrical Engineering (EE)</a>
from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html">Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, South Korea</a>
and
MS &amp; Ph.D. degrees in <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/">EE</a>
from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University, CA, USA</a>
under supervision of <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/">Prof. Stephen P. Boyd</a>,
who is a legendary figure in the field.
&mdash;
Having <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/">him</a> as my advisor was one of the luckiest things that have ever happened to my life!

I specialize in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/">Convex Optimization</a>
leading cutting-edge projects across diverse sectors including semiconductor design, strategic marketing with market intelligence,
e-commerce, industrial AI, and biotech
while <font class="emph">driving business development, connecting people, and consulting people in diverse industries</font>.
My focus is on leveraging the AI technology especially around AI agents
which essentially based on the recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLM) and multimodal generative AI (GenAI)
to drive business innovation, predict industry trends, assess their broad impacts on society, economy, and policy,
provide policy and technology recommendations
by understanding and having differentiated insight
into technology, industry, business, and markets.

As a
<a href="https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative">KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow</a>,
I develop actionable solutions for the challenges posed by a rapidly changing world by AI.
My work focuses on &ldquo;Technology, Growth, and Inequality: The Case of AI,&rdquo;
within the broader theme of &ldquo;Uncertain Futures and Connections Reimagined: Connecting Technologies.&rdquo;
I also actively contribute to AI and semiconductor technology policy making,
advising state and national governments
while considering the geopolitical dynamics of key players like the US, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

I also dedicate to fostering knowledge, insight, and experience transfer and innovation
by serving as
