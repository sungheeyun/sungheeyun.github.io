<p>
	Before founding this new AI biotech company,
	I co-founded <a href="https://www.gausslabs.ai/">Gauss Labs, Inc.</a>, an industrial AI company,
	and set up and ran <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/v2cLgonB46fL9CPh8">US Headquarters of Gauss Labs</a>,
	and
	led research, development &amp; productionization of the core technology.
	Before <a href="https://www.gausslabs.ai/">Gauss Labs</a>, I developed various AI technology and products
	in the field of e-Commerce @ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com, Inc.</a> where one of the projects
	created 200 USD revenue increase via Amazon Mobile Shopping App.
	Before <a href="https:///www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>,
	I worked for
		Software Research Center,
		Strategic Sales &amp; Marketing Team,
		Design Technology Team
		&amp;
		Computer-Aided Engineering Team
		of <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/">Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.</a>
	where
		I developed huge number of
		AI and optimization tools
		for semiconductor design engineers, manufacturing process engineers &amp; test engineers
	where
		more than 200 engineers still use the generic analog/digital/mixed-signal circuit optimization tools
		every day.
	I received BS degree
	in <a href="https://eng.snu.ac.kr/snuEng/main/contents.do?menuNo=200084">Electrical Engineering (EE)</a>
	from <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html">Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea</a>
	and MS and Ph.D. degrees in <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/">EE</a>
	from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University, CA, USA</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I specialize in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/">Convex Optimization</a>, leading cutting-edge projects across diverse sectors including semiconductor design, strategic marketing, e-commerce, industrial AI, and biotech. My focus is on leveraging the latest in Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative AI (GenAI) to drive business innovation, predict industry trends, and assess their broad impacts on society, economy, and policy.
</p>

<p>
	I actively contribute to state and government policy-making on AI and semiconductor technology, considering geopolitical dynamics among key global players like the US, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.
</p>

<p>
	I also dedicate to fostering knowledge transfer and innovation
	by serving as Adjunct Professor at Sogang University,
	Advisory Professor at DGIST,
	and Network Expert at Gerson Lehrman Group.
</p>

<p>
	My Life Goal, though, is to secure a future for all, where health, safety, liberty, and equity are paramount.
