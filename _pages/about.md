My focus is on leveraging the AI technology especially around AI agents
which essentially based on the recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLM) and multimodal generative AI (GenAI)
to drive business innovation, predict industry trends, assess their broad impacts on society, economy, and policy,
provide policy and technology recommendations
by understanding and having differentiated insight
into technology, industry, business, and markets.
