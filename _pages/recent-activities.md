# Who I Am

I am Co-Founder &amp; CTO at [Erudio Bio, Inc.](https://www.erudio.bio/){:target="_blank"}
and Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Erudio Bio Korea, Inc.
where we're pioneering AI-driven biomarker discovery and drug development,
serve as a [KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative){:target="_blank"}
and
a Member of AI-Korean Medicine Integration Initiative Task Force for the [Association of Korean Medicine](https://www.akom.org){:target="_blank"},
and
hold positions as Adjunct Professor at Sogang University and Advisory Professor at DGIST.

I'm also Leader of the [Silicon Valley Privacy Preserving AI Forum (K-PAI)](https://k-privateai.github.io/){:target="_blank"}—a role that has unexpectedly become one of the defining aspects of my career.
Through K-PAI, I've become widely recognized throughout Silicon Valley's Korean community
for building this vibrant community of AI professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, journalists, and industry leaders.

**<span style="color:red;">The K-PAI phenomenon</span>** has been one of the most unexpected turns in my career.
What began in November 2024 as a forum for privacy-preserving AI has grown into
a movement—hosting 10+ major events (within a year!),
attracting hundreds of attendees,
partnering with
[K-BioX](https://kbiox.net/){:target="_blank"},
[KOTRA Silicon Valley](https://www.connectkotrasv.org/){:target="_blank"},
[K&bull;ASIC](https://www.kasicusa.com/){:target="_blank"},
and
creating a vibrant community that has fundamentally changed how I'm known in Silicon Valley.
Today, when people in the South Bay Korean tech community think "AI", they think "[K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/){:target="_blank"}". <!--and "Sunghee Yun."-->

My journey has taken me from
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"},
semiconductor optimization &amp; Machine Learning (ML) at Samsung,
through e-commerce innovation via Artificial Intelligent (AI) at Amazon (where one project generated $200M in revenue),
to co-founding [Gauss Labs](https://gausslabs.ai/){:target="_blank"} and serving as CTO—an industrial AI company—and now to the frontier of AI-powered biotechnology.
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University,
where I studied under [Prof. Stephen P. Boyd](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/){:target="_blank"}, the world's leading authority on Convex Optimization.

What drives me is connecting the dots between seemingly disparate fields. My background spans the theoretical depth of mathematics and convex optimization, the practical demands of engineering and AI development, and the philosophical questions of how technology shapes society. This interdisciplinary perspective allows me to see patterns others might miss—whether in technology trends, market dynamics, or the broader societal implications of AI advancement.

# Leadership Roles

## Erudio Bio - Co-Founder &amp; CTO / Erudio Bio Korea - Co-Founder &amp; CEO

<!--
At [Erudio Bio](https://sungheeyun-erudio.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, we're building AI-powered platforms for biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Our approach combines multimodal AI, large language models, and biological knowledge graphs to accelerate drug discovery and development.

**Recent Milestone** In 2025, Erudio Bio was awarded a grant from the **[Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}** to advance our work in AI-driven biomarker platforms for global health challenges.
-->

At [Erudio Bio](https://www.erudio.bio/){:target="_blank"}, we're pioneering the next generation of drug discovery and precision medicine through AI-powered biomarker platforms. Our mission is to transform how we understand disease, identify therapeutic targets, and develop treatments—accelerating the path from biological insight to patient impact.

**The Vision: AI-Driven Biological Intelligence**

The pharmaceutical industry faces a fundamental challenge: despite massive investments, drug development remains slow, expensive, and failure-prone. Most drug candidates fail in late-stage trials because we don't fully understand the biological mechanisms of disease. Erudio Bio is changing this paradigm by building AI systems that can integrate and reason across the entire landscape of biological knowledge—from genomics and proteomics to clinical data and scientific literature.

<!--
**Technical Approach**

Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technologies:
- **Multimodal AI**: Integrating diverse data types—genomic sequences, protein structures, medical imaging, electronic health records, and scientific literature
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Processing and understanding vast bodies of biomedical research to extract insights that would be impossible for humans to synthesize manually
- **Biological Knowledge Graphs**: Representing complex relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs in computationally tractable ways
- **Agentic AI Systems**: Autonomous AI agents that can formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and iteratively refine biological understanding

This convergence allows us to discover biomarkers—biological signatures of disease—that are more precise, more predictive, and more actionable than traditional approaches.
-->

**Recent Milestones**

**Gates Foundation Grant (2025)**: We were awarded a prestigious grant from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} to advance our AI-driven biomarker platforms for global health challenges. This recognition validates our approach and extends our impact beyond commercial drug development to addressing diseases that disproportionately affect underserved populations.

**Versatile Smart Assay (VSA) Platform**: Our patented VSA technology represents a breakthrough in biomarker detection, enabling rapid, accurate, and cost-effective analysis of multiple biomarkers simultaneously. We developed this technology in partnership with world-class institutions:
- **[Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/){:target="_blank"}** - Semiconductor and signal processing technology
- **[Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}** - Clinical validation and medical expertise
- **[Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}** - Translational research and innovation

**Strategic Partnerships & Collaborations**

We're building an ecosystem of world-class partners across academia, healthcare, and industry:

*Clinical & Research Partnerships:*
- **[Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH)](https://www.snubh.org/){:target="_blank"}**: Joint development of integrated biochip medical device for cancer diagnosis and monitoring using our VSA platform for multiple biomarker detection—a collaboration that brings our AI-driven insights directly into clinical practice

This partnership network spans the US and Korea, connecting Silicon Valley innovation with Korean clinical excellence and manufacturing capabilities.

**What Makes Erudio Bio Different**

<!--
Unlike traditional biotech companies that focus on a single therapeutic area or drug candidate, we're building foundational AI infrastructure that can accelerate discovery across multiple diseases simultaneously. Our platform learns from every analysis, every dataset, every published paper—becoming more powerful and more insightful over time.

Our **Versatile Smart Assay (VSA)** technology bridges the gap between AI-driven discovery and clinical application—enabling us not just to identify biomarkers computationally, but to actually measure them in patient samples with unprecedented speed and accuracy. This end-to-end capability, from computational discovery to clinical detection, is rare in the industry.
-->

We're also uniquely positioned at the intersection of:
- **Silicon Valley AI innovation** and **biotech/pharma domain expertise**
- **Cutting-edge machine learning** and **rigorous biological validation**
- **Academic research excellence** and **commercial product development**
- **US and Korean markets**, with operations in both countries

<!--
**Why This Matters**

The convergence of AI and biology represents one of the most consequential technological transformations of our era. Just as AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, AI-powered platforms like ours can revolutionize how we discover drugs, understand disease mechanisms, and ultimately improve human health.

For me personally, Erudio Bio represents the culmination of my journey from theoretical optimization to practical AI applications. After years of applying AI to semiconductors and e-commerce, working on problems that directly impact human health and longevity feels profoundly meaningful. We're not just building better algorithms—we're building tools that could help cure diseases, extend healthy lifespan, and reduce human suffering.

**The Path Ahead**

We're rapidly expanding our team, deepening our partnerships with world-leading medical institutions like SNUBH, Harvard Medical School, and Stanford Medicine, and building strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies and research organizations globally. Through collaborations like our cancer diagnostic device development with SNUBH and data platform integration with Lulumedic, we're scaling our VSA platform to tackle increasingly complex biological questions across multiple disease areas.

Our goal is to become the essential AI infrastructure layer for the next generation of precision medicine—the platform that every pharma company, biotech startup, hospital system, and academic researcher uses to accelerate their work from discovery to clinical application.

## Silicon Valley Privacy Preserving AI Forum (K-PAI) - Founder & Leader
**November 2024 - Present**

What started as a vision has grown into one of the most unexpected and transformative chapters of my career.
As Founder and Leader of [K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/){:target="_blank"},
I've built a thriving community that has made me a household name among Korean professionals throughout Silicon Valley's South Bay.
Today, nearly every Korean in the South Bay (tech) community knows me as
"the K-PAI person"—a recognition that reflects the Forum's remarkable impact and reach.

**The K-PAI Movement**

K-PAI is a pioneering community of professionals dedicated to building privacy-preserving Artificial Intelligence solutions
through cross-disciplinary collaboration,
bridging technical innovation with legal frameworks and humanistic principles.
What makes K-PAI unique is its holistic approach—we don't just discuss technology; we explore the intersection of AI with privacy, security, ethics, business, policy, and human values.

**Community Impact**

Since our launch in November 2024, K-PAI has become the premier forum for AI professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers in Silicon Valley. Our monthly forums attract:
- Top speakers from leading companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, SK hynix, LG, a16z crypto, Altos Ventures, Quinn Emanuel)
- Professors from world-class universities (Stanford, Arizona State, Seoul National University)
- Executives and founders from cutting-edge AI startups
- Policymakers and legal experts shaping AI regulation

# What Makes My Perspective Unique

My approach to AI and technology is grounded in unusual depth across multiple dimensions:

**Mathematical Foundations** I studied under [one of few living legends in optimization theory (and the only legend throughout the human history in Convex Optimization)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/), giving me rare insight into the mathematical structures that underpin modern AI. This theoretical grounding enables me to understand not just how AI systems work, but why they work—and more importantly, when they won't.
(Please refer to the blog posts about (pure) math that I've written [here](/math/) for better understanding!)

**Cross-Industry Experience** From semiconductor manufacturing to e-commerce to biotech, I've seen how AI transforms different industries. This breadth reveals patterns in technology adoption, implementation challenges, and business value creation that are invisible when viewing a single sector.
(Please refer to my blog posts related to these topics such as
[this](/multi-agent-ai-biz-landscape)
or [this](/ai/data)
or [this](/ai/llm/energy-challenge)!)

**Technology-Humanities Bridge** While deeply technical, I'm equally engaged with philosophy, history, cognitive science, and social sciences. This allows me to think about AI not just as a technology problem but as a societal transformation—considering questions of consciousness, ethics, economic equity, and human flourishing alongside technical architecture and algorithmic efficiency.
(Please refer to some of my blog posts or articles related to these topics such as
[this](/ai/bridging-technology-and-humanity)
or [this](/ai/salzburg-report-case-of-ai)
or [this](/prajna/wisdom-of-strategic-ignorance)
or [this](/prajna/wonders/richness-of-musical-notes)
or [this](/ai/reason)!)

**Entrepreneurial & Strategic Lens** Having co-founded companies and advised Fortune 500 executives, I understand the full spectrum from breakthrough research to market realization, from technical feasibility to business viability, from product development to strategic positioning.
(Please refer to my special lectures on various topics of AI and Convex Optimization and consultations for executives of Fortune 500 companies [here](/#sem)!)

**Community Builder & Connector** Through founding and leading [K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/), I've demonstrated the ability to build thriving communities that bridge disciplines, cultures, and institutions. This community-building expertise—connecting people, ideas, and opportunities—has become one of my most impactful contributions to Silicon Valley's tech ecosystem.
(You can see everything, I mean everything about K-PAI [here](https://k-privateai.github.io/),
including, but not limited to, [all the forum announcements, reflections, blog posts](https://k-privateai.github.io/posts/), [partnership](https://k-privateai.github.io/#perpetual-partnership-with-kotra), [K-PAI membership](https://k-privateai.github.io/membership/), and [K-PAI committee](https://k-privateai.github.io/committee/)!)

This convergence of
[mathematical rigor](/math),
[engineering expertise](/about),
[cross-industry experience](/about/more),
and
[humanistic perspective](/ai/bridging-technology-and-humanity) allows me to offer
insights that bridge the gap between technical possibility and human necessity—between
what AI can do and what it should do,
but more importantly, how and what **<span style="color:red;">we</span>** should do!

# Looking Forward

The convergence of AI with biotechnology, the evolution of privacy-preserving technologies, and the urgent need for ethical AI governance present both opportunities and responsibilities. Through my work at Erudio Bio, K-PAI, and as a Salzburg Fellow, I'm committed to ensuring that as AI systems become more powerful, they serve humanity's long-term flourishing—advancing health, preserving liberty, promoting equality, and ultimately enabling genuine human happiness.

K-PAI will continue to grow as Silicon Valley's premier forum for responsible AI innovation, bringing together the brightest minds to tackle the most pressing challenges at the intersection of AI, privacy, security, and human values. We're not just discussing the future—we're actively building it, one conversation, one connection, one breakthrough at a time.

My goal isn't just to build better technology, but to build better futures—futures where technological advancement and human values aren't in tension but in harmony.
