# Who I Am

[I](/) am Co-Founder &amp; CTO at [Erudio Bio, Inc.](https://www.erudio.bio/){:target="_blank"}
and Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Erudio Bio Korea, Inc.
where we're pioneering AI-driven biomarker discovery and drug development,
serve as a [KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative){:target="_blank"}
and
a Member of AI-Korean Medicine Integration Initiative Task Force for the [Association of Korean Medicine](https://www.akom.org){:target="_blank"},
and
hold positions as Adjunct Professor at Sogang University and Advisory Professor at DGIST.

I'm also Leader of the [Silicon Valley Privacy Preserving AI Forum (K-PAI)](https://k-privateai.github.io/){:target="_blank"}—a role that has unexpectedly become one of the defining aspects of my career.
Through K-PAI, I've become widely recognized throughout Silicon Valley's Korean community
for building this vibrant community of AI professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, journalists, and industry leaders.

**<span style="color:red;">The K-PAI phenomenon</span>** has been one of the most unexpected turns in my career.
What began in November 2024 as a forum for privacy-preserving AI has grown into
a movement—hosting 10+ major events (within a year!),
attracting hundreds of attendees,
partnering with
[K-BioX](https://kbiox.net/){:target="_blank"},
[KOTRA Silicon Valley](https://www.connectkotrasv.org/){:target="_blank"},
[K&bull;ASIC](https://www.kasicusa.com/){:target="_blank"},
and
creating a vibrant community that has fundamentally changed how I'm known in Silicon Valley.
Today, when people in the South Bay Korean tech community think "AI", they think "[K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/){:target="_blank"}". <!--and "Sunghee Yun."-->

My journey has taken me from
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"},
semiconductor optimization &amp; Machine Learning (ML) at Samsung,
through e-commerce innovation via Artificial Intelligent (AI) at Amazon (where one project generated $200M in revenue),
to co-founding [Gauss Labs](https://gausslabs.ai/){:target="_blank"} and serving as CTO—an industrial AI company—and now to the frontier of AI-powered biotechnology.
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University,
where I studied under [Prof. Stephen P. Boyd](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/){:target="_blank"}, the world's leading authority on Convex Optimization.

What drives me is connecting the dots between seemingly disparate fields. My background spans the theoretical depth of mathematics and convex optimization, the practical demands of engineering and AI development, and the philosophical questions of how technology shapes society. This interdisciplinary perspective allows me to see patterns others might miss—whether in technology trends, market dynamics, or the broader societal implications of AI advancement.

# Some of My Press Exposures

- [에루디오바이오, 게이츠재단 지원금 기반 신약개발혁신 플랫폼 만든다](https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2025103008554006190){:target="_blank"}
	&ndash; 아시아경제
	@ 30-Oct-2025 KST

> 현재 신약 개발의 90% 이상이 임상시험에서 실패한다. 약물과 인체의 상호작용이 너무 복잡해 초기 단계에서 충분히 검증하지 못하기 때문이다. 에루디오바이오의 bioTCAD는 동적 힘 분광법으로 측정한 고품질 분자 상호작용 데이터를 활용해, 동물실험 단계인 전임상에서 신약 설계를 더욱 신뢰할 수 있고 빠르게 만든다. 의약품 개발 비용을 낮추고 개발 기간을 단축함으로써 새로운 저비용치료법을 절실히 필요로 하는 저소득 및 중소득 국가(LMICs)가 혜택을 받을 수 있다.
>
> 한편 에루디오바이오는 지난 7월 한국 법인 에루디오바이오코리아를 설립해 서울대학교 분당병원과 암 바이오마커 검출 제품 공동 개발을 추진하고 있다. 한국인 특화 암 진단 솔루션 개발을 목표로 기관생명윤리위원회(IRB) 승인 절차가 진행 중이며, 연내 승인 완료를 목표로 하고 있다. 이 기술은 기존 다중화 진단의 핵심 한계인 교차반응성과 위양성 문제를 해결해 암 조기 진단의 정확도를 크게 높일 수 있을 것으로 기대된다. 내년 상반기 첫 임상 데이터를 확보하고, 2027년 상반기 식품의약품안전처에 의료기기 허가를 신청할 예정이다.

At [Erudio Bio](https://www.erudio.bio/){:target="_blank"}, we're pioneering the next generation of drug discovery and precision medicine through AI-powered biomarker platforms. Our mission is to transform how we understand disease, identify therapeutic targets, and develop treatments—accelerating the path from biological insight to patient impact.

### The Vision - AI-Driven Biological Intelligence

The pharmaceutical industry faces a fundamental challenge: despite massive investments, drug development remains slow, expensive, and failure-prone. Most drug candidates fail in late-stage trials because we don't fully understand the biological mechanisms of disease. Erudio Bio is changing this paradigm by building AI systems that can integrate and reason across the entire landscape of biological knowledge—from genomics and proteomics to clinical data and scientific literature.

<!--
**Technical Approach**

Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technologies:
- **Multimodal AI**: Integrating diverse data types—genomic sequences, protein structures, medical imaging, electronic health records, and scientific literature
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Processing and understanding vast bodies of biomedical research to extract insights that would be impossible for humans to synthesize manually
- **Biological Knowledge Graphs**: Representing complex relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs in computationally tractable ways
- **Agentic AI Systems**: Autonomous AI agents that can formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and iteratively refine biological understanding

This convergence allows us to discover biomarkers—biological signatures of disease—that are more precise, more predictive, and more actionable than traditional approaches.
-->

### Recent Milestones

<span style="color:red;">**Gates Foundation Grant (2025)**</span> We were awarded a Prestigious Grant from the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} to advance our AI-driven biomarker platforms for global health challenges. This recognition validates our approach and extends our impact beyond commercial drug development to addressing diseases that disproportionately affect underserved populations.

- <span style="color:red;">**US and Korean markets**</span> with operations in both countries

<!--
**Why This Matters**

The convergence of AI and biology represents one of the most consequential technological transformations of our era. Just as AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, AI-powered platforms like ours can revolutionize how we discover drugs, understand disease mechanisms, and ultimately improve human health.

For me personally, Erudio Bio represents the culmination of my journey from theoretical optimization to practical AI applications. After years of applying AI to semiconductors and e-commerce, working on problems that directly impact human health and longevity feels profoundly meaningful. We're not just building better algorithms—we're building tools that could help cure diseases, extend healthy lifespan, and reduce human suffering.

**The Path Ahead**

We're rapidly expanding our team, deepening our partnerships with world-leading medical institutions like SNUBH, Harvard Medical School, and Stanford Medicine, and building strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies and research organizations globally. Through collaborations like our cancer diagnostic device development with SNUBH and data platform integration with Lulumedic, we're scaling our VSA platform to tackle increasingly complex biological questions across multiple disease areas.

Our goal is to become the essential AI infrastructure layer for the next generation of precision medicine—the platform that every pharma company, biotech startup, hospital system, and academic researcher uses to accelerate their work from discovery to clinical application.

As a [KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative){:target="_blank"},
I'm part of an international cohort addressing the theme "[Uncertain Futures and Connections Reimagined: Connecting Technologies](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/multi-year-series/kfas/pageId/11076){:target="_blank"}."

Our group focuses on **"Technology, Growth, and Inequality: The Case of AI"** — examining how artificial intelligence is simultaneously driving economic growth and potentially widening societal inequalities. We're developing actionable policy recommendations for how nations can harness AI's benefits while ensuring equitable access and mitigating risks.

**Key Activities**:
- Co-authoring policy reports on AI fairness, digital ethics, and equitable access
- Engaging with global leaders, policymakers, and researchers across the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific
- Developing frameworks for responsible AI deployment in critical sectors including healthcare, finance, and education
- Bridging perspectives between Silicon Valley innovation culture and global regulatory approaches

# What Makes My Perspective Unique

My approach to AI and technology is grounded in unusual depth across multiple dimensions:

<span style="color:red;">**Mathematical Foundations**</span> I studied under [one of few living legends in optimization theory (and the only legend throughout the human history in Convex Optimization)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/), giving me rare insight into the mathematical structures that underpin modern AI. This theoretical grounding enables me to understand not just how AI systems work, but why they work—and more importantly, when they won't.
(Please refer to the blog posts about (pure) math that I've written [here](/math/) for better understanding!)

<span style="color:red;">**Cross-Industry Experience**</span> From semiconductor manufacturing to e-commerce to biotech, I've seen how AI transforms different industries. This breadth reveals patterns in technology adoption, implementation challenges, and business value creation that are invisible when viewing a single sector.
(Please refer to my blog posts related to these topics such as
[this](/multi-agent-ai-biz-landscape)
or [this](/ai/data)
or [this](/ai/llm/energy-challenge)!)

<span style="color:red;">**Technology-Humanities Bridge**</span> While deeply technical, I'm equally engaged with philosophy, history, cognitive science, and social sciences. This allows me to think about AI not just as a technology problem but as a societal transformation—considering questions of consciousness, ethics, economic equity, and human flourishing alongside technical architecture and algorithmic efficiency.
(Please refer to some of my blog posts or articles related to these topics such as
[this](/ai/bridging-technology-and-humanity)
or [this](/ai/salzburg-report-case-of-ai)
or [this](/prajna/wisdom-of-strategic-ignorance)
or [this](/prajna/wonders/richness-of-musical-notes)
or [this](/ai/reason)!)

<span style="color:red;">**Entrepreneurial & Strategic Lens**</span> Having co-founded companies and advised Fortune 500 executives, I understand the full spectrum from breakthrough research to market realization, from technical feasibility to business viability, from product development to strategic positioning.
(Please refer to my special lectures on various topics of AI and Convex Optimization and consultations for executives of Fortune 500 companies [here](/#sem)!)

<span style="color:red;">**Community Builder & Connector**</span> Through founding and leading [K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/), I've demonstrated the ability to build thriving communities that bridge disciplines, cultures, and institutions. This community-building expertise—connecting people, ideas, and opportunities—has become one of my most impactful contributions to Silicon Valley's tech ecosystem.
(You can see everything, I mean everything about K-PAI [here](https://k-privateai.github.io/),
including, but not limited to, [all the forum announcements, reflections, blog posts](https://k-privateai.github.io/posts/), [partnership](https://k-privateai.github.io/#perpetual-partnership-with-kotra), [K-PAI membership](https://k-privateai.github.io/membership/), and [K-PAI committee](https://k-privateai.github.io/committee/)!)

This convergence of
[mathematical rigor](/math),
[engineering expertise](/about),
[cross-industry experience](/about/more),
and
[humanistic perspective](/ai/bridging-technology-and-humanity) allows me to offer
insights that bridge the gap between technical possibility and human necessity—between
what AI can do and what it should do,
but more importantly, how and what **<span style="color:red;">we</span>** should do!

# Looking Forward

The convergence of AI with biotechnology, the evolution of privacy-preserving technologies, and the urgent need for ethical AI governance present both opportunities and responsibilities. Through my work at Erudio Bio, K-PAI, and as a Salzburg Fellow, I'm committed to ensuring that as AI systems become more powerful, they serve humanity's long-term flourishing—advancing health, preserving liberty, promoting equality, and ultimately enabling genuine human happiness.

K-PAI will continue to grow as Silicon Valley's premier forum for responsible AI innovation, bringing together the brightest minds to tackle the most pressing challenges at the intersection of AI, privacy, security, and human values. We're not just discussing the future—we're actively building it, one conversation, one connection, one breakthrough at a time.

My goal isn't just to build better technology, but to build better futures—futures where technological advancement and human values aren't in tension but in harmony.
